## Project Overview

It's my first Java project, and this project is a news management system developed using `JDK 17`, `Spring Boot 3`, and `Maven 3`. It provides functionalities for managing news and visitor data. The system also includes a recommendation feature that suggests news based on a user's browsing history.

It's also included a front-end application developed using `vue 3` to demonstrate the system's functionalities.
